# PythonTools
Author:  Jett Bolen (Moleman114)
This repository is for my Python-based toolkit. It contains small python scripts that I work on as a practice programming exercise to automate tasks for future re-use.

## Tools Created
- [X] QRCoder.py - Small script to generate QR Codes as pngs and output them to /outputs
- [X] Folderizer.py - Script to organize files in a directory based on their file type. Values are hard-coded in a dictionary.
